Welcome to Unreal Tournament!
=============================

This is the project page for **Unreal Tournament** on GitHub.  Unreal Tournament is being created in close collaboration between Epic and the Unreal Engine 4 developer community.  You’ll be able to see live commits from Epic developers along with integrated code submissions from the community!  You can also use this code as a starting point for experimentation and Unreal Tournament mod creation.

As described in the [License Agreement](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealTournament/blob/master/LICENSE.pdf), assets residing in **UnrealTournament/Content/RestrictedAssets** may only be used for Unreal Tournament submissions.

We’re working hard to get a basic version of Unreal Tournament deathmatch up and running to provide a basis for design iteration and further development. You can follow our progress on this fork, and start extending or modding the code as it becomes functional. If you want to get involved, join us on our [forums](http://forums.unrealengine.com/forumdisplay.php?34-Unreal-Tournament) to participate in design discussions, find projects that need help, and discover other opportunities to contribute.

Check out the [Unreal Tournament wiki](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Unreal_Tournament_Development) for documentation on the design and development process of the game.



How to get started
-------------------

The current Unreal Tournament project is based on Unreal Engine version 4.1.0.  You can always get this version of the engine using the [Unreal Engine Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard), or you can grab the [full engine source](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases/tag/4.1.0-release) from GitHub and compile it yourself.

**Downloading the Unreal Tournament project:**

- Download the project by clicking the **Download Source** button on this page.
- Unzip the files to a folder on your computer.  
- Load up [Unreal Editor](https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard)
- On the Project Browser screen, click **Browse** and navigate to the folder where unzipped the files.
- Choose the **UnrealTournament.uproject** file.  

You'll now be looking at the very latest work-in-progress version of the game!
